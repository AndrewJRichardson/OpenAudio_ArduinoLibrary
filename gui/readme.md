This gui folder is fr the stand-alone Open Audio Design tool for
floating point Teensy audio.  To run a local, not Internet Design tool,
create a new directory (folder) anywhere that it is convenient and call it
something like DesignTool_F32. In order to read this readme.md, you must
have found the OpenAudio_Arduino gui directory.  From this same directory,
copy the file  DesignTool_F32.zip to your new directory and extract all files.
The files/folder are not in a containing folder.  You can point your
browser at the file index.html and the Design Tool will be in full
oeration.
